openwork with strangers (system, youless)
blood
sausage. handwork
of blood,—
claymud. 

a tree of linden and a tree of peaches—and,
in between them, strands and strands
of prima materia, aqua regia spilling over rock. near elche. not so much
a fold in the feeling as

sacraments
—hand over hands thrones 
like calicthrones. 
black pudding in desks, 

the sound of the singular, erosion
across strangeness, so much water
inside the space the cold water
is about to burst over—canyons—canyonslike, budding prairies—but like

lilycoal plazas, my masters,
canals
—locks, shore birds
with low, sad, calls.

and i loved the image, the framed painting i would
have filled with birds. not the surface with four
blue shimmers but what the image covered (gothic light). not
the unknown but the diamond’s core in knowing, mathemical point where a name would have

sufficed erything,
emptied touches—black gelatin
—handful of mucus, lilies.
babies, calico human.

the frogs by my mother’s sewing kit after the rain. i love them. i love her more
than the lace in the curtains. the vinegar tunnelling through the carrots in the bowl.
i love them. calico under the trees at night—pure calico, calico without tragedy.
sleeping in a mirror room. then, not sleeping. not sleeping ever again.
