<h4 class="roast_title">Hot hands vanishing in air</h4>
<p class="roast_line">no one wants to be here, where we met, furnacesgardens with benches</p>
<p class="roast_line">so dark it’s night. right now it’s night.—no one wanted to be night</p>
<p class="roast_line">as much as you did, black seeds like your early beard,</p>
<p class="roast_line">—dark white beaches. the old man who woke up early to walk his dog </p>
<p class="roast_line">is no where to be found. so as the girl who sings the order of the sea.</p>
<p class="roast_line">everyone who doesn’t understand you has a flowervase in which</p>
<p class="roast_line">you are hiding, hidden. this city (venice?) is not venice. it is not even</p>
<p class="roast_line">troy,—troy visible </p>
<p class="roast_line">and venice, old vienna. </p>
<p class="roast_line">troy where you live, </p>
<p class="roast_line">brickmaker, my pianist.—</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">troy where i might’ve lived with you</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">—you are living a sonata, great might.</p>
<p class="roast_line">and the amputated birds sing on the barbed wire of the city monitor,</p>
<p class="roast_line">love budding in thin air while we wring the hot  hands dry.</p>
<p class="roast_line">what were you doing all night in the field below the castle? i fell asleep</p>
<p class="roast_line">on the floor by the bed, reading pavese and woke up at the bottom</p>
<p class="roast_line">of a well with you making strange figures in shadow with your hands.</p>
<p class="roast_line">sometimes it seems like—not just we are not made for each other but—</p>
<p class="roast_line">we are not for each other. or, </p>
<p class="roast_line">ocean floor, our inheritance</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">of unruliness,</p>
<p class="roast_line">planets.—so it will be young planets.</p>
<p class="roast_line">have you growled</p>
<p class="roast_line ind2">and disowned me?</p>
<p class="roast_line">when i sleep on the floor by</p>
<p class="roast_line">your bed</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">have you growled and disowned me?</p>
<p class="roast_line">half open sails, molten earth.</p>
<p class="roast_line">calcium minus silver, osmium minus gold. birch lace, already</p>
<p class="roast_line">—i’d upset you dearly</p>
<p class="roast_line ind3">and when i woke up, you had shaved your face.</p>
<p class="roast_line">It is with a knife that you cut off the wrong grass.</p>
<p class="roast_line">bleeding songs dropping from the unbalanced head. morning in haze. you used to be free.</p>
<p class="roast_line">and on your way to the office, a stranger waved his arm </p>
<p class="roast_line">from a broken bike. suddenly, the crosswalk tilted. the world opening again.</p>
