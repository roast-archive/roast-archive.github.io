points of singularity in the island, like an immobile itinerary (this is where i thought i was)
with your palm under a tin goblet
running over through the bottom,—
old decades will mix
surfactants into the coffee
and we will come crowned, poor, 
from the forest gates (under
a cover of night and chicken feathers)
having traded shirts, false papers, guns.
you are wearing a tank top. i am wearing
a moon-scarf and sequins but you call me
“malina,” which isn’t my name though
i wish it were yours. back and forth—
you in the steps of your master,
me stepping on your goat's neck,
turning my foot (this feather
is no longer a cover)
so as to cause him as much pain as possible,
and i wept, in the steps of your master.
back and forth, i don't want us
to be mistaken for people, students.
i want us to be islands.
skyscraper high schools. i don’t need to be
where i am to know what i can see
around me—the peach trees growing
inside clouds, 
the drunk soldiers, everlasting delight.

***

when we come crowned
we'll be fools,
but we won't take the handfuls of herring or farmer cheese
that life may hand us.
we won't see—heirs of the righteous, the miraculous—banners for a while, 
but we'll still be wary, stumbling thru gates
and courtyards, circuses 
of the forest we'll have left.
forest 1 = {jean valentine, socialist realism, tin cans
of glass, immutable form, immutable immemory, my
misbehaviour of you.} ⊗ forest 2 = {hatred of patrimony, lacrimae
rerum, ariadne in an oversized blazer, linendogs, the music
of the bears in trees mistaking cherries
for air, breathable air.} 
when you wake up i'll call for you.
—in my forest of you
you're dancing, prophesying, 
ordering cups of chicory coffee and unbelievable plates of dumplings and little pigeons.
when you give away your life for me
i might wake up!
