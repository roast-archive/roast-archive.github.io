    	A roast for everything we've got. Barnstorming, but, like, an actual storm. All of our hands, shot through the immaterial. With love. All hands on deck. All hands turned inside out like a little bottlecap of amore.
    </h4>
	<p class="roast_line">
		Allverything we said in that house in Marietta was like a cataclysm, no, a hemoclysm, but only with heart-blood, and we kept almost-noticing it all. Atoms. You were building a typewriter with keys for things like <i>-ing</i> and <i>-er</i> and I was practicing cheap telepathy.
	</p>	
	<p class="roast_line">
		Bridge where we lose it. Yes there is a new world, even on a one-way street. There is no memory. There is a list of people that I have not dreamed about and, if I sent it to them, they wouldn’t cry.
	</p>	
	<p class="roast_line">
		Chess, but we're crushing. Lucifer played the Catalan opening. "It's the only one to play in a free-fall," he said when he did. You wagered your hand-copied copy of One-Way Street, and that thing mightaswellvebeen autographed. I knew then that there was nothing to be afraid of. I knew we would fuckin' crush. 
	</p>	
	<p class="roast_line">
		Deadly coffee. Bitter Seville orange. Parsley. All of my life of it. Literally all of my life of me dangling from the stem of the jar, the goat of the curtain. It’s not that I need more connections to the physical world but that my balcony is falling. All morning I slept inside all of my life. I knew all of my life.
	</p>	
	<p class="roast_line">
		Every permutation of the letters in God's name. Soft, cozy algebra. Warmth of the air conditioning. Unabashed roteness. So. We'll pronounce them all, barely, like barley, and somewhere in there, unite frequency and period: Your sincere and bitter birth. 
	</p>	
	<p class="roast_line">
		Fireflies everywhere. In the day-old coffee suddenly turned sweet. In the first-edition of Scholem. No more lamps in the fortress. We clear out every room to fit more ceiling in it. So it’s harder for your face to separate the roof from the walls.
	</p>	
	<p class="roast_line">
		Go. Notice the myriad... Scholem's living, beating heart of mysticism. He's tossing it to you. Why won't you catch it? Notice the horror in your face... You can feel the soul of your jaw turning it downwards, can't you? Yea. It's because we've been slaughtering the classics. Pure restlessness. Literally pure restlessness.
	</p>	
	<p class="roast_line">
		Heavy-handed salvation. We didn’t even try to hide what we wanted. All night we were tucking the dog into bed, cooking orange syrup on the stove, and the apartment smelled like your hair. Wait. Don’t turn around yet. The dog is asleep and the syrup is ready but the lock hasn’t yet undone itself.
	</p>	
	<p class="roast_line">
		Ixacting divine justice. Returning to the eternal-untoing, so we can destroy law. So we can write the laws-unto-ourselves. <i>Orange syrup?</i> Turn, you heavy-handed pure-poet unto-eschatology, turn! The earth swallowed me up, bloodlessly and returnlessly, and I didn't even get to return around. I didn't even get to see סְדֹם and עֲמֹרָה fall down. What a waste.
	</p>	
	<p class="roast_line">
		June. Climbing Montjuïc with Albertine to watch the battle mechs cruise through Barcelona. The city is getting is (because you asked.) destroyed just so they can rebuild every building in it one floor shorter. Drinking tomato juice with Albertine. Learning Hebrew with Albertine while she reads Proust. I must absolutely marry Proust.
	</p>	
	<p class="roast_line">
		Ketamine. So much we could cry. Pearls-of-madeleine-cake, lost in the rose-yellow fireworks. Oh, Moran! Oh, Moraneleine! Let's sedate Rosemary! We can move out to the countryside, we can move the countryside! (They flew into the ocean.) Port wine! Chrysanthemums! Your handgun! 
	</p>
	<p class="roast_line">
		Lopsided descending technique, down the sandy chain of stairs by my house. If you ever visit, I would cook you fried quail eggs, heirloom tomatoes, cold sand in pear juice. All my bottlecaps are gone. To not waste time, I put everything already outside. 
	</p>
	<p class="roast_line">
		More hearts-in-a-returning. More sweet capes. Moran darling, I'm sorry. As long as we spend the summers here, we can't play dumb anymore. We may be young, but we're old souls. We may be beautiful, but we're fucked up. When we came back it was too obvious. Escher won't forgive us.  
	</p>
	<p class="roast_line">
		New York. Alright, New York, but just 46th Bliss Street where we have still not stopped to have tea, even though it’s summer and we too would like to be excruciatingly happy. All winter my parents were sending me lens-wiping cloths with flowers on them and little Italian bags of pistachios. Now all I do is drink tap water, eat rice in bed.  
	</p>
	<p class="roast_line">
		Original-paradisiacal. I'm remembering all of these Things. A formlessness of matte blue forget-me-nots, rocking in the soft air. Those times when we would run up six flights of stairs, two steps at a time, to get to your apartment. It was always so dark in there haha. Original-pandemonial. Wonder. It's starting to seem more like equal parts wonder and perfect laziness.   
	</p>
	<p class="roast_line">
		Perfect-pandemonial. Perfect-wonder. I don’t think I care how it seems, as long as it perfects me. Perfect-parts wonder and laziness, like the anchor flying through the air. Like. It doesn’t even matter, as long as you tuck me in at night. Perfect-tucking-technique. Perfectly-timed-rest.   
	</p>
	<p class="roast_line">
		Quaint pandemonium. I don't care how it seems, I'm giving it my all. A really quaint kind of all, though. You don't trust me anymore, but that's because I don't need your trust. Materials trust me enough. Hey. I saw the milky way in the sky, last night, I think. Hm. Like the whole heaven-and-earth thing? I don't really buy it. Heavenearth. Show me how to kiss.    
	</p>
	<p class="roast_line">
		Roving packs of wild tea-dogs, stripping our cupboards empty of tea leaves. My kettle is gone. My house is gone. I’m thinking about Buñuel as a young man. Adorno as a young man. Benjamin and Scholem, laughing at how full their lives are, and yet I think ours are fuller. And yet I think that their lives are meaningless compared to ours. That’s not what I meant to say but the ice cream is so good… the water is so cold but still warm.    
	</p>
	<p class="roast_line">
		Saki watch out! Glück is coming to hit you over the head with her posthumous collection! I have a line and you have a line! They rhyme with <i>-ing!</i> Holy shit thank god we have a typewriter for that! We'll use these to fight her off, shotgun-couplet-style. If Glück uses language we can dismember it (thanks Benji!) and if she uses language-naked-of-symbol we can annihilate it (thanks Gerhard!) and… 
	</p>
	<p class="roast_line">
		Tap the table until it glows (it can’t stay unlit.) It’s something to do with pressure and lions. Something to do with the pressure that brings you home and the one that unmakes you in a black turtleneck under a sea of string lights. If we’re both home, we’re not with each other, but we’re with each other in the very same pressure that brings us separately home. Tap my home until it glows, with one more staircase under the bed. One more chandelier in evening.
	</p>
	<p class="roast_line">
		Underneath that heart-of-desires of yours has to be a heart-of-mystery. Let me just find out… inside of everything we don't have is something we hold dear. We just have to keep-finding-out. I mean, we believed in a desperately-vagrant-fullness so hard it became Material, and after that, after we kept-finding-out-believing, it just… became a little grey bird, like a prayer. 
	</p>
	<p class="roast_line">
		Valentine, St. Every time we check on him, he’s still alive. And yet it’s clear that when we aren’t checking on him, he’s dead. It’s a game we play with ourselves, a way to divide time between ourselves and keeping-Valentine-alive. Like playing chess with your dad using the Leningrad Dutch and he loses everything except his body…
	</p>
	<p class="roast_line">
		Worry. Pureperfect worry. I'm sorry Milan. I keep using 'pureperfect' and I know you think I stole it from you but you definitely stole it from Kerouac first and… we can still pureperfect this whole thing wide open. Let's go. Let's steal some pureperfect from the eternal-pureperfect and put a little emphasis on the <i>-ect</i> like you do and let's just go. Right now. The grey bird. Perfect-time. I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry Milan I'm sorry Moran I'm sorry God I'm sorry I'm sorry

		X-Benjamin, the robot warrior version of him that Scholem built for his grandchildren. Equipped with a map of Ibiza, a fully operational one-way street, a detective novel featuring Asja Lacis, Walter Benjamin, and the precise depth of the Atlantic at its highest point. X-Benjamin-Mage-2, the sex robot that Scholem built in a giant pool of his tears.

	<p class="roast_line">
		You were born with those eyes. They're big, green, and always concerned. Do you know how hard that is for me? You were born into an empty world and you're the heir of emptiness. Sometimes you put red eye-shadow on and send me pictures like the world is about to end. That would make it <i>so</i> empty.
