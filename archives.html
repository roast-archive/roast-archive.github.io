		Bridge where we lose it. Yes there is a new world, even on a one-way street. There is no memory. There is a list of people that I have not dreamed about and, if I sent it to them, they wouldn’t cry.

	<p class="roast_line">
		Chess, but we're crushing. Lucifer played the Catalan opening. "It's the only one to play in a free-fall," he said when he did.

		Deadly coffee. Bitter Seville orange. Parsley. All of my life of it. Literally all of my life of me dangling from the stem of the jar, the goat of the curtain.

		Go. Notice the myriad... Scholem's living, beating heart of mysticism. He's tossing it to you. Why won't you catch it? Notice the horror in your face...

		Heavy-handed salvation. We didn’t even try to hide what we wanted. All night we were tucking the dog into bed, cooking orange syrup on the stove, and the apartment smelled like your hair. Wait. Don’t turn around yet. The dog is asleep and the syrup is ready but the lock hasn’t yet undone itself.

		New York. Alright, New York, but just 46th Bliss Street where we have still not stopped to have tea, even though it’s summer and we too would like to be excruciatingly happy.

It's starting to seem more like equal parts wonder and perfect laziness.

		Quaint pandemonium. I don't care how it seems, I'm giving it my all. A really quaint kind of all, though. You don't trust me anymore, but that's because I don't need your trust.

		Roving packs of wild tea-dogs, stripping our cupboards empty of tea leaves. My kettle is gone. My house is gone. I’m thinking about Buñuel as a young man. Adorno as a young man. Benjamin and Scholem, laughing at how full their lives are, and yet I think ours are fuller. And yet I think that their lives are meaningless compared to ours.

		Tap the table until it glows (it can’t stay unlit.) It’s something to do with pressure and lions. Something to do with the pressure that brings you home and the one that unmakes you in a black turtleneck under a sea of string lights. If we’re both home, we’re not with each other, but we’re with each other in the very same pressure that brings us separately home. Tap my home until it glows, with one more staircase under the bed. One more chandelier in evening.

		Underneath that heart-of-desires of yours has to be a heart-of-mystery. Let me just find out… inside of everything we don't have is something we hold dear. We just have to keep-finding-out. I mean, we believed in a desperately-vagrant-fullness so hard it became Material, and after that, after we kept-finding-out-believing, it just… became a little grey bird, like a prayer.

		Valentine, St. Every time we check on him, he’s still alive. And yet it’s clear that when we aren’t checking on him, he’s dead.

Like playing chess with your dad using the Leningrad Dutch and he loses everything except his body…
