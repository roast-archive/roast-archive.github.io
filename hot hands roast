Hot hands vanishing in air
no one wants to be here, where we met, furnacesgardens with benches
so dark it’s night. right now it’s night.—no one wanted to be night
as much as you did, black seeds like your early beard,
—dark white beaches. the old man who woke up early to walk his dog 
is no where to be found. so as the girl who sings the order of the sea.
everyone who doesn’t understand you has a flowervase in which
you are hiding, hidden. this city (venice?) is not venice. it is not even
troy,—troy visible 
and venice, old vienna. 
troy where you live, 
brickmaker, my pianist.—
    troy where i might’ve lived with you
    —you are living a sonata, great might.
and the amputated birds sing on the barbed wire of the city monitor,
love budding in thin air while we wring the hot  hands dry.
what were you doing all night in the field below the castle? i fell asleep
on the floor by the bed, reading pavese and woke up at the bottom
of a well with you making strange figures in shadow with your hands.
sometimes it seems like—not just we are not made for each other but—
we are not for each other. or, 
ocean floor, our inheritance
of unruliness,
planets.—so it will be young planets.
have you growled
and disowned me?
when i sleep on the floor by
your bed
    have you growled and disowned me?
half open sails, molten earth.
calcium minus silver, osmium minus gold. birch lace, already
—i’d upset you dearly
            and when i woke up, you had shaved your face.
It is with a knife that you cut off the wrong grass.
bleeding songs dropping from the unbalanced head. morning in haze. you used to be free.
and on your way to the office, a stranger waved his arm 
from a broken bike. suddenly, the crosswalk tilted. the world opening again.
