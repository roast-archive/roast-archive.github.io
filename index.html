		THE WAY OF THE UPRIGHT. FABLE, MYTH, & ENTITY ITSELF. THE SPACESHIP KITCHEN HAS VANISHED THOUGH THE REST OF THE SPACESHIP IS STILL THERE. WE ARE NOT ON IT & IT’S WHERE WE BELONG. SOVTEK ELECTRON TUBES AND PRECISION FUSES. The story we're telling versus the dark, spiritual eyes of the storyteller's son… You refused to eat garlic, onions, herring, or even too-smoky rye bread. BLOODHOUNDS & DOVES ROAST.
