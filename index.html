			Is the fountain falling inside of <i>us</i>? All the oysters just sort of… went away. But you're buying semi sour pickles now. They're really green — and I'm really not supposed to say this — but your eyes are too. It's so bad. We were doing 95 in a 30 and all I could think about was how, if I looked over at you, we wouldn't even crash. There'd be green hills. 
	  	</p>	
	  	<p class="roast_line">
			There’d be more letters in the trunk. There’d be melted Tuscan chocolates in my pocket, fragrant when we open them and fall asleep, 100 (years) in a 30. There’d be no more marriage. No more prisons. No more metal-hopscotch on a windy beach, the one

			true love. I mean, the boundary of a Poincaré disk. Fuck, wait wait. What I meant to say was, I think we could take down geometry together, once and for all. Make it fear us. Blaspheme infinities together. Like chase 'em down to the end of that beach. Crush living mussels with living stones. 
	  	</p>
	  	<p class="roast_line">
			E.B. White is not ok, by which I just mean that there’s no way he could be healthy right now. The birthday party was heartfelt and confusing. No one understood the mussels or why they were so happy. No one understood infinity, real dripping infinity, the one in comic strips, pea soup, I don’t think anyone got it. Ok, now we steal E.B. White’s dwindling health for ourselves

	  	<p class="roast_line">
			but we leave his letters the hell alone. When we were on the very bottom, feeling for strange stones with our feet, I was feeling quite hopeless. I thought you were lying, you know, when you would describe the odd shapes to me. I thought the empty spaces around our hands <i>were</i> our hands? I knew you threw out <i>The Elements of Style</i> but I also knew you photocopied all your favorite pages first. Every thing under water was so quiet and dry,

			like solace in a teen movie, the blinds drawn each morning to let the light in even better, let it beat its way in where there’s anywhere to go. The basket of oranges. The bed absolutely undone in the corner, all my clothes beneath the printer-scanner-combo. Brie cheese. Wait. I think I’m forgetting something:
	  	</p>
	  	<p class="roast_line">
			The way you would eat raw, whole jalapenos when you were trying to think. You'd call me and say your mouth was burning. You'd say, in these deep husky tones, that all the beauty in the world was draining out with the rain. I almost forgot all about that. Your penchant for Kalamata olives, too.

	  	<p class="roast_line">
			Ok, get ready. It’s gonna be a Vespa night. Archaeological sites by Thessaloniki, us on our scooters fitted with titanium mesh jumping wheels, no one loves, really, I mean really, no one loves or runs as fast as we do, as hopelessly as we do, as caught as we are. None of us happens. None of us. None of us. I mean none of us. I mean none of us. None of us matters.

			Justice is sticking sparklers up our shirts. Lament is lifting our laughter, glittering, into the pure olive sky. It's okay. I think we're gonna be okay. E.B. and I have been hanging out on the awning recently, just because it's way too hot inside. He says that Justice is secretly in love with Lament. I want to write a love poem for them but, as soon as I try, we all fall off the awning in a lifting-kind-of-origin. The world's great big machine, deep and wide. The world —

			all the beauty in the world is wavering. Love, you look so beautiful in my roller skates while we masturbate (the precipice). You look so beautiful by the tumbling lightbulbs and little baby dogs (the precipice), so beautiful in a communal spacesuit (we’re not about let Earth get away even a slice of the moon). See? We made it. We didn’t take the acid. Our hands are shaking. Like Eurydice, we’re in Freeville. The car (105 in a 15) didn’t crash.
