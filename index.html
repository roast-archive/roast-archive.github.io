		A roast which never ends. A six square-inch block of wreality. A roast to save our enemies from death. The roast which finally encapsulates action. The roast where we finally stretch out our hands to grasp our eternal salvation, because we've received orders to do so. Remember that time we were in Shahi Pakwan talking to that other table about a poem written in a very bright room? This is that poem. It's summer and this is that room. Fly, all my love, fly! I’m cooking fish in the attic while you destroy anchovies in the back yard. Yes, it's true. The anchovies are made of uncreated light. I'm full of guilt so white-hot it'd destroy us all if I spoke just one word. I… let's go. A wreath which never starts.
