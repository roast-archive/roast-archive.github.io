<p class="roast_line">I put down these things on the table—the wedding invitation, the bracelet, stems of leaves, this time <i>I</i> open the wedding. There is something</p>

<p class="roast_line"><i>my</i> Mercury. <i>My</i> your-Moses, who almost certainly grabbed for the jewels as opposed to the burning coal. Who spoke like almond oil, milk, cloudy </p>
<p class="roast_line">but not vague—opaque with saintliness, pride and clarity—because, of course, your</p>
<p class="roast_line">-his tongue was unburned. Was unburned, in strings of pearls on books. Because, the dimension of the life he wanted to live was generous</p>
<p class="roast_line">enough that, everything he was offered he flew to it like it was already his. Spiritual burning. Sage exploding</p>
<p class="roast_line">in the Egyptian tradition. In the Midianite tradition. Sage, that is,—mercy which is impossible to <i>really</i> receive,—basil, while you gesture over great spilled wine,</p>
<p class="roast_line">in a story. I loved Midian, there were no gardens so I strung the nets without holes coming off from your heart like arms around my neck.</p>
