<h4 class="roast_title">The last attempt at a self-consistent system of necessity, an attempt—in the final analysis—to smuggle the blueprints, to pass one hand through the other while they turn invisible, while life inverts me for you. (1x1)</h4>
<div class="roast_stanza">
<p class="roast_line">a big story.</p>
<p class="roast_line">what always, you, vain,</p>
<p class="roast_line">can escape.</p>
<p class="roast_line">lays the plan for hands-</p>
<p class="roast_line">upon-</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">—no,</p>
<p class="roast_line">us rereading with</p>
<p class="roast_line">out joy. </p>
<p class="roast_line">co-</p>
<p class="roast_line">vertly breathing</p>
<p class="roast_line">black vinegar lime-</p>
<p class="roast_line">stone</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">why </p>
<p class="roast_line">this our</p>
<p class="roast_line">season, prideful</p>
<p class="roast_line">but for mom,</p>
<p class="roast_line">three ships in-</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">side docks,</p>
<p class="roast_line">flowering you away</p>
<p class="roast_line">you, home, subterfugue.</p>
</div>
  	
<h4 class="roast_title">images are untouchable (you can touch the reel of film but not the image)</h4>
<div class="roast_stanza">
<p class="roast_line">whatever you will reach </p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">with your essay</p>
<p class="roast_line">your deathbed will surely reach.</p>
<p class="roast_line">for what is across the table,</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">a sacrament (what you need</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">to make your life’s desire real, so as not</p>
<p class="roast_line ind2">to live in a dream), you—</p>
<p class="roast_line">without the order given</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">—will not reach.</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">and then the sacrament becomes an ordinance. the order</p>
<p class="roast_line">was on fire once. the order was mountains</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">enfolded in mountains once—rigorously,</p>
<p class="roast_line ind2">theoretically. the way, in mathematics,</p>
<p class="roast_line ind2">coefficient is the element of dreaming.</p>
<p class="roast_line">memory is thinking—not</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1"><i>was.</i> we had not met for</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">forty years and we meet in my new deck</p>
<p class="roast_line">of cards. THE WHITE CASTLE and…</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">THE MOVING IMAGE…</p>
<p class="roast_line">the moving letters, as well, </p>
<p class="roast_line">from the sanitorium, with handwritings which—</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">in your state (you hardly</p>
<p class="roast_line">would eat, and</p>
<p class="roast_line ind2">when we met you asked me </p>
<p class="roast_line">for cherries and nothing else)—</p>
<p class="roast_line">could only have been perfect</p>
<p class="roast_line ind3">forces of will.</p>
<p class="roast_line">kinds of forces which </p>
<p class="roast_line">will never reach an equilibrium,</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">and through which necessity was to meet good,—</p>
<p class="roast_line">the thin blind air of the mountains,</p>
<p class="roast_line">the window obscuring two young trees—</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">the summer house was filled with vampire bats who,</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">mom noticed, were attracted to the glasses</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">on our table—i thought, does the glass smell</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">of blood? but how could it since only our lips</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">were on it, and lips have nothing to do with blood, you</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">are climbing the trees,</p>
<p class="roast_line">and obviously work has to do with blood,</p>
<p class="roast_line">the table’s carpenter, </p>
<p class="roast_line">the bats’ mathematician,—</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">it’s like the joke you would tell</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">about the café without cream</p>
<p class="roast_line">which can only make you coffee without milk, not coffee without cream,</p>
<p class="roast_line ind2">—like how the vampire bats can smell us</p>
<p class="roast_line">because obviously our lips aren’t bleeding</p>
<p class="roast_line">and we’ve already</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">put the glasses down from our mouths… </p>
<p class="roast_line">and if you betrayed my letters,</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">and you were already in jail,</p>
<p class="roast_line">i would stare at the stars all day.</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">and count them. and what matters</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">is the moment of unconcern when you</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">are UNNECESSARY and i</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">am NECESSARY by the positions in language</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">we occupy—what it means to be an i,</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">to be a you, which means what matters</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">is not be an i, so you are not a you. so BETRAYAL</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">would not. LETTERS would not. in great</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">patience, the moment of impatience which</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">is like… relief. to drink water flowing AWAY from me while</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">pulling back, pulling myself in the other direction,</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">also AWAY. which would be ETHICS-FASCINATION,</p>
<p class="roast_line">the kind of attention</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">which only saves <i>you</i></p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">from monotony—</p>
<p class="roast_line ind2">passing seasons and</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">seasons under grapevine trunks,</p>
<p class="roast_line">against milling machines</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">—but doesn’t equivalently </p>
<p class="roast_line ind1"><i>your death</i> save.</p>
<p class="roast_line">attention at all, </p>
<p class="roast_line">which would according to you</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">transform love into death’s love for life, </p>
<p class="roast_line">the moment of death into the entire moment of life,</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">biscuits André would dip</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">in chocolate—all the while </p>
<p class="roast_line">crying huge tears</p>
<p class="roast_line ind2">while thinking of us ‘starving’</p>
<p class="roast_line ind2">here—into the war,</p>
<p class="roast_line">or whatever he read in the newspaper</p>
<p class="roast_line">which could’ve been anything at all.</p>
