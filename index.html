<h4 class="roast_title">Scenes of life (after some Calder thing…) (after talking about life) (after changing places) (after carefully considering all relevant chemicals…)</h4>
<div class="roast_stanza">
<p class="roast_line">calder wake up. not from dying. the look</p>
<p class="roast_line">on a stranger’s face. when it feels like,</p>
<p class="roast_line">for a split second, you could know them.</p>
<p class="roast_line">understand. dog. what follows emptiness </p>
<p class="roast_line">but always precedes the next thing. </p>
<p class="roast_line">what that is i was hoping you knew. </p>
<p class="roast_line">what we are i was hoping you knew. earth</p>
<p class="roast_line">wake up aliens are here. and they miss troy,</p>
<p class="roast_line">cleopatra’s pearls, leaves in envelopes</p>
<p class="roast_line">of silk. when the sirens rang over </p>
<p class="roast_line">new york i got out the map we made,</p>
<p class="roast_line">in middle school, as a joke—the one on</p>
<p class="roast_line">gold hide, cement. the blank one with our names on it.</p>
<p class="roast_line">the joke that contained our entire lives. </p>
<p class="roast_line">calder wake up because i can’t stand your dream </p>
<p class="roast_line">any longer. dream wake up, i miss talking with you. about</p>
<p class="roast_line">what art doesn’t understand. what misunderstanding</p>
<p class="roast_line">is constitutive of art. why hope. why hope</p>
<p class="roast_line">disappears like a scratch-mark on a huge</p>
<p class="roast_line">block of ice. do you know me? do you</p>
<p class="roast_line">cold me? i am rigid cold,—yes. yes. yes</p>
<p class="roast_line">of course, although you don’t know why.—leaves in</p>
<p class="roast_line">envelopes will you ever turn to mortar. cleopatra’s</p>
<p class="roast_line">pearls will you ever turn to outer space, knowing</p>
<p class="roast_line">precisely nothing about art. humans, ice, nothing </p>
<p class="roast_line">of what you expect you will expect. nothing </p>
<p class="roast_line">of what you try to save will be saved for calder.</p>
<p class="roast_line">we look like we’re asleep on a boat anchored</p>
<p class="roast_line">before the journey. why does it matter. we</p>
<p class="roast_line">can’t see us. each of us can see each other</p>
<p class="roast_line">but we can’t see us. we, us. each other, us.</p>
<p class="roast_line">what will it take me to save you.</p>
<p class="roast_line">what will it take me to save you.</p>
<p class="roast_line">earth the split second before the joke makes sense</p>
<p class="roast_line">is here what will it take me to save you…</p>

<div class="roast_stanza">
<p class="roast_line">no one wants to be here, where we met, furnacesgardens with benches</p>
<p class="roast_line">so dark it’s night. right now it’s night.—no one wanted to be night</p>
<p class="roast_line">as much as you did, black seeds like your early beard,</p>
<p class="roast_line">—dark white beaches. the old man who woke up early to walk his dog </p>
<p class="roast_line">is no where to be found. so as the girl who sings the order of the sea.</p>
<p class="roast_line">everyone who doesn’t understand you has a flowervase in which</p>
<p class="roast_line">you are hiding, hidden. this city (venice?) is not venice. it is not even</p>
<p class="roast_line">troy,—troy visible </p>
<p class="roast_line">and venice, old vienna. </p>
<p class="roast_line">troy where you live, </p>
<p class="roast_line">brickmaker, my pianist.—</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">troy where i might’ve lived with you</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">—you are living a sonata, great might.</p>
<p class="roast_line">and the amputated birds sing on the barbed wire of the city monitor,</p>
<p class="roast_line">love budding in thin air while we wring the hot  hands dry.</p>
<p class="roast_line">what were you doing all night in the field below the castle? i fell asleep</p>
<p class="roast_line">on the floor by the bed, reading pavese and woke up at the bottom</p>
<p class="roast_line">of a well with you making strange figures in shadow with your hands.</p>
<p class="roast_line">sometimes it seems like—not just we are not made for each other but—</p>
<p class="roast_line">we are not for each other. or, </p>
<p class="roast_line">ocean floor, our inheritance</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">of unruliness,</p>
<p class="roast_line">planets.—so it will be young planets.</p>
<p class="roast_line">have you growled</p>
<p class="roast_line ind2">and disowned me?</p>
<p class="roast_line">when i sleep on the floor by</p>
<p class="roast_line">your bed</p>
<p class="roast_line ind1">have you growled and disowned me?</p>
<p class="roast_line">half open sails, molten earth.</p>
<p class="roast_line">calcium minus silver, osmium minus gold. birch lace, already</p>
<p class="roast_line">—i’d upset you dearly</p>
<p class="roast_line ind3">and when i woke up, you had shaved your face.</p>
<p class="roast_line">It is with a knife that you cut off the wrong grass.</p>
<p class="roast_line">bleeding songs dropping from the unbalanced head. morning in haze. you used to be free.</p>
<p class="roast_line">and on your way to the office, a stranger waved his arm </p>
<p class="roast_line">from a broken bike. suddenly, the crosswalk tilted. the world opening again.</p>
