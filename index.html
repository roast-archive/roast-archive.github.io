		Cherrybomb echelon. Vermillion fish in the once-familiar bathtub. My scythe is singin' away the angel-blues. I love my candle-puppy. I hope he stays unlit. I'm trying to lift you out of this deep, dark well, but you're pregnant, and my counterweight is made of just light, here. Your stocky countertenor.

			My counterweight, dizzy with lightness, dizzy with the way I am always less than more unlit than you are. Our vegetable garden

	  	<p class="roast_line">
			is made of malachite tablets and low-background steel. Only when we're dreaming
	  	</p>
	  	<p class="roast_line" >

	  	<p class="roast_line">
			Where does the light pour out from all of our things. Why is every room in the house dark while we look fungal-fluorescent.

			Liveasmonkandmonkess. There'll be a big green river.

	  	<p class="roast_line">
			There’ll be celery hearts soaked in hot sauce. There’ll be relief. Deruta porcelain. Daybreak in medieval Umbria. Dangerous monotype Pokémon battles. Something that holds our heads together while we roll down blizzard alley because we want me to die for exteriority, the outside’s sake. 
	  	</p>
	  	<p class="roast_line">
			Something that suspends us just above the river's surface for all our hesychasms.

	  	<p class="roast_line">
			When we drop in, we'll be <i>inside</i> Merkabah mysticism. No light filters on down there, absolutely none at all. We'll have to survive just off our memories of light. Periodicity and porcelain. We'll kiss Ezekiel. I wonder if those'll be half as good as our own kisses? Uncreated porcelain. 
	  	</p>
	  	<p class="roast_line">
			I wonder if our old math homework will still make sense. That’s why you were kissing me anyways so sloppily. That’s why the love we have is cave-temporary like we know it is. I make you menemen on Saturdays. I make you gambas al ajillo when you’re sick, with a side dish of Catalan tomato bread. I make you vesper-sourdough, for Venus himself. I wonder why water doesn't just fall through the porcelain dish

			into my hands on the crown of your head. All I want is rest. Ninety more years of

			this, of recreating death. All I want is to understand cloud formation. Why
	  	</p>
	  	<p class="roast_line">
			do they always have to look just like you? How did they withdraw from formlessness like that, and can I? I wanna loosen-up language so we can use it to fight monism. And the porcelain. I was kinda serious about the south west.  
	  	</p>
	  	<p class="roast_line">
			Death-serious. The green river was made of the shekhinah. Truth, and the whole monism of angels inside the truth, gets fuller and fuller each day when we

			wake up outta bed. One'a these days, real, true light is gonna be born
	  	</p>
	  	<p class="roast_line">
			so we better load up on forehead kisses while we’re still glowing. We better light up all the candles we can, in the muddy canal where otters play. We better inject chlorophyll into our nightly coffee, memorize the face of every angel during early mornings in the unknown librarycafe. Death-serious. What does that mean for us. Us.
