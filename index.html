		Come, you predatory wolf. This is the infinitesimal knot from which you were born. Let me read to you for nine nights straight (the kind of nights with no days in between) the play where you eat all my letters in the final scene. Let me read to you the transcript of all our wrestling matches. Wolves (they say) are upturned flowers. Angels (they say to wolves) are the upturning ground. HOW TO DRAW PROF. SIGMUND FREUD.

  			through the circle of the ground. I remember talking (in rich, abysmal tones) about
		</p>
		<p class="roast_line">
  			the planetarium of your dreams and nothing else. I held presupposition dearly,

		<p class="roast_line">
  			almost, you said, heartlessly. Is that what hearts are for? Giant skating rinks where I hate you,

  			Are dreams what hearts are for? Then, what? Your piano is still full of icelessness,

  			helps me matter. Lightning over Ibiza. Do you still remember the mainland? Your hand

		<p class="roast_line">
  			holding my hand doesn’t help me at all. It’s like public baths. Roadside memorials for
