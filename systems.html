			</p>
			<p class="roast_line">
				And the way you mistake everything for voyage. Even masslessness in a public library filled with rain forest. Even the anger you mistake for recombination, the game you play with my roommate's persimmons in the bathroom. How many times do I have to measure the poetry of light before it soaks in? Beating through the ice in the faucet. The glacialfloodplainhearts of ice in my favorite faucet.

			<p class="roast_line">
				The faucet I use to shave before I came here to write poems with you, bathed in radioorchardsilence. Bathed in self-deleting filesystems and dynamical systems of rain and unrelenting faith while my brothers go rock climbing and my sisters fall through the ceilings (of my heart being washed up in your bathtub.) What does the world face if not for lovely feral justice? What does the world face in my heart but astringent aftershave, swinging rusty maces? (I can’t believe you attacked me in the middle of the night, even if I was unplugging your dreams.)
			</p>
			<p class="roast_line">
				The quantum field theory interpretation of us is murderously… generous. I'll tell you all about it in the next poem. The road trip interpretation of us has so many layers… like jellyfish stacked on jellyfish while you unplug the sink at last. The system of life versions of us are eating pizza in underwaternewyork & crying into windows. The windows that remember us. The versions of us in the exact same utopia but just a little different are talking about dreamless kissing, historyless kissing, the kind they do in the shadowbooks that our favorite books need. When you go home I stop thinking about lizards-on-the-wall-systems-of-interpretation. I stop thinking about fishfood…
			</p>
			<p class="roast_line">
				I start thinking about strangulation and eternity. Every fish, a swinging reflection of the sea. Us, while we dream through the sea-interpretation of the stars, swinging reflections of hand-holding, emergent behavior (in the finally unplugged dreamsink), true-love-interpretations of lovelessness. When we sit here like this I want to think about mystery instead of the roof. When you make the speech at the end, darkeyed and urgent, I can’t help but think of vengeance and utter cold. I can’t believe you took the propane out of my lungs/hugs while the streetroom gets colder, I can’t believe I can still dream when I’ve lost all faith in interpretation. Here is the ice-core of my heart: propane-sickness —> capillaries —> a poem about a paralyzed will —> the massive weather we will only ever pretend to understand. I will only ever pretend to understand you, even while you exchange my shirt for your heart @ Caffé Reggio. It could be anywhere, the starsystem.
			</p>
			<p class="roast_line">
				It could be @ Caffé Reggio. It could cook us eggs & focaccia in a public bathroom. It could stop making sense. Love, I am orders of magnitude larger & colder than your parallelheartcore. I am shivering. I am trying so hard to write your poem.

				of poetry: glowing and vibrating pizza-oil on wax paper. Absolute terror of my life: the days into which we are leaping. The reactor cores we hid under the street, I still know where they are. The wordless prayers you slipped in between the cores, I still feel them slipping through my life. Why
			</p>
			<p class="roast_line">

			<p class="roast_line">
				Sorry, I only remember my life-kissing-emeralds. I only remember the emeralds of your vague blue(green)prints. What do you know about speeches? I've never given a speech in my life and already I can rule the world. I've never felt raw power but I'm ready to kiss you. Erasing the operating system, filling the bootloader with aubades of mysterious light:
			</p>
			<p class="roast_line">
				when you rest your head against the reactor like that you know I have to pounce. I have to jump into the core we learn from, dark green putting my fingernails finally in order. I guess we were underground this whole time, soaked in ice, barely breathing. Every time you try to work out the nodes in the system your house is on fire while I set your calcium powder on fire. 
			</p>
			<p class="roast_line">
				There's so much ice left for us to reset our alarm clocks. There's so much time left for me to put out the fire which is burning and the reactor is going…
