<h4 class="roast_title">We might never raise non-being to being’s place, lower being to nothing. You wrote that with grandma in mind. You wrote that having already put it all into ghost literature.

<div class="roast_stanza">
<p class="roast_line">and between non-being and nothing the sleeve of your blouse catches like fire in a film</p>
<p class="roast_line">lighting up, in the projector, where the film divides. and every night you sneak away</p>
<p class="roast_line">from your mother’s house into the river, for the sequence in perception it does to you—</p>
<p class="roast_line">mud, then water, then the grass, a metamorphic sexuality</p>
<p class="roast_line">from which you are hardly inspired. from which the sequence transforms into a series, the mud <i>and then</i> the water <i>and then</i> the grass <i>and then</i> the sexuality (which</p>
<p class="roast_line">here has lost its metamorphic character) underneath the additive ‘then,’ the absorptive ‘then,’</p>
<p class="roast_line">the quiet river which can at any time emerge and swallow you. you the prodigy, precisely </p>
<p class="roast_line">you the absent friend. you hysterically brave under the mosaic’s spell—being</p>
<p class="roast_line">yourself of pieces, but believing in the unitary soul made of parts. and the part of you you keep immiscibly for yourself being</p>
<p class="roast_line">precisely the shadow that builds for itself a light behind the wall, and a cassandra behind the light (every wall</p>
<p class="roast_line">is a key shaped like a castle’s keep. built in a glacier.) the thing about contradiction is…</p>
<p class="roast_line">i won’t say it. you won’t get it out of me 😸. a crystal with three faces for the three phases of being: {beloved / marginality / completeness.} being’s</p>
<p class="roast_line">asundering—the castle can keep nothing inside it. non-being’s assimilation—peasants will not be free, violence can keep the castle in it. if, as you always like to say,</p>
<p class="roast_line">contradiction is an equilibrium between two forces, then why</p>
<p class="roast_line">are they guarding the empty castle walls? why do the walls not falling leave such a bad taste in our mouths? the forces</p>
<p class="roast_line">may be in equilibrium, but their exact counterforces are in complete disarray. the punishment</p>
<p class="roast_line">may be complete—these days, may even be graceful,—but in my dreams </p>
<p class="roast_line">you’re so close i can touch you.</p>
<p class="roast_line">but i prefer static. dark green wool. but i believe, not in the concrete link but in the abstract windstorm, believe in SOUL, WORLD, JEWELS, REVENGE—</p>
<p class="roast_line">only three of those. griselda (name from the german, meaning “grey battle”) and bellerophon (from the greek, poseidon’s son), my terrifying lieutenants, the dark horde</p>
<p class="roast_line">of romans is running through the bubbles we are blowing at them. they are brilliant, in a way—<i>beryllus.</i> which makes my head freeze… flatten… just then, just in that moment</p>
<p class="roast_line">that passed, i sensed an uncertainty in you, what is the meaning of it?—the uncertainty is,</p>
<p class="roast_line">of course, that i don’t know whether the uncertainty is in me or you.</p>
<p class="roast_line">i don’t know whether our war will be total or incomplete. what i want to destroy in you </p>
<p class="roast_line">has to be what you’ve already destroyed in yourself, otherwise… we’d be warriors and not, as </p>
<p class="roast_line">we seem to be at precisely this moment, warriors in command. </p>
<p class="roast_line">you prefer static but i prefer fireflies. you, dark green wool, me, your dark green wool. </p>

				And the way you mistake everything for voyage. Even masslessness in a public library filled with rain forest. Even the anger you mistake for recombination, the game you play with my roommate's persimmons in the bathroom. How many times do I have to measure the poetry of light before it soaks in? Beating through the ice in the faucet. The glacialfloodplainhearts of ice in my favorite faucet.

Bathed in self-deleting filesystems and dynamical systems of rain and unrelenting faith while my brothers go rock climbing and my sisters fall through the ceilings (of my heart being washed up in your bathtub.) What does the world face if not for lovely feral justice? What does the world face in my heart but astringent aftershave, swinging rusty maces? (I can’t believe you attacked me in the middle of the night, even if I was unplugging your dreams.)
			</p>
			<p class="roast_line">
				The quantum field theory interpretation of us is murderously… generous. I'll tell you all about it in the next poem. The road trip interpretation of us has so many layers… like jellyfish stacked on jellyfish while you unplug the sink at last. The system of life versions of us are eating pizza in underwaternewyork & crying into windows. The windows that remember us. The versions of us in the exact same utopia but just a little different are talking about dreamless kissing, historyless kissing, the kind they do in the shadowbooks that our favorite books need. When you go home I stop thinking about lizards-on-the-wall-systems-of-interpretation. I stop thinking about fishfood…
			</p>
			<p class="roast_line">
				I start thinking about strangulation and eternity. Every fish, a swinging reflection of the sea. Us, while we dream through the sea-interpretation of the stars, swinging reflections of hand-holding, emergent behavior (in the finally unplugged dreamsink), true-love-interpretations of lovelessness. When we sit here like this I want to think about mystery instead of the roof. When you make the speech at the end, darkeyed and urgent, I can’t help but think of vengeance and utter cold. I can’t believe you took the propane out of my lungs/hugs while the streetroom gets colder, I can’t believe I can still dream when I’ve lost all faith in interpretation. Here is the ice-core of my heart: propane-sickness —> capillaries —> a poem about a paralyzed will —> the massive weather we will only ever pretend to understand. I will only ever pretend to understand you, even while you exchange my shirt for your heart @ Caffé Reggio. It could be anywhere, the starsystem.
			</p>
			<p class="roast_line">
				It could be @ Caffé Reggio. It could cook us eggs & focaccia in a public bathroom. It could stop making sense. Love, I am orders of magnitude larger & colder than your parallelheartcore. I am shivering. I am trying so hard to write your poem.

				when you rest your head against the reactor like that you know I have to pounce. I have to jump into the core we learn from, dark green putting my fingernails finally in order. I guess we were underground this whole time, soaked in ice, barely breathing. Every time you try to work out the nodes in the system your house is on fire while I set your calcium powder on fire.
