cazimi-alexander
for rhythmarionettes. what new years for you,
new emotions, sun conjunct forest, fear
is for me. fear, clairvoyant but not—our year
of silk in our dna. be true not to me—be true,

for your judges, for sleepth into deapth. die how
you need to die. you are oak and ice, four-thrice
the treasures you’d die with, you’d cover your face,
alexander. you’d take a drink of necklace. frown.

for whatever we don’t touch but can, we won’t
see. and whatever we love but can’t, we
bring it to our death. i bring you to me
were you not behind me, summering—don’t 
be meaningful, meaning’s morning star
you star however far away from me to you are.
