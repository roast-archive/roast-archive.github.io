Scenes of life (after some Calder thing…) (after talking about life) (after changing places) (after carefully considering all relevant chemicals…)
calder wake up. not from dying. the look
on a stranger’s face. when it feels like,
for a split second, you could know them.
understand. dog. what follows emptiness 
but always precedes the next thing. 
what that is i was hoping you knew. 
what we are i was hoping you knew. earth
wake up aliens are here. and they miss troy,
cleopatra’s pearls, leaves in envelopes
of silk. when the sirens rang over 
new york i got out the map we made,
in middle school, as a joke—the one on
gold hide, cement. the blank one with our names on it.
the joke that contained our entire lives. 
calder wake up because i can’t stand your dream 
any longer. dream wake up, i miss talking with you. about
what art doesn’t understand. what misunderstanding
is constitutive of art. why hope. why hope
disappears like a scratch-mark on a huge
block of ice. do you know me? do you
cold me? i am rigid cold,—yes. yes. yes
of course, although you don’t know why.—leaves in
envelopes will you ever turn to mortar. cleopatra’s
pearls will you ever turn to outer space, knowing
precisely nothing about art. humans, ice, nothing 
of what you expect you will expect. nothing 
of what you try to save will be saved for calder.
we look like we’re asleep on a boat anchored
before the journey. why does it matter. we
can’t see us. each of us can see each other
but we can’t see us. we, us. each other, us.
what will it take me to save you.
what will it take me to save you.
earth the split second before the joke makes sense
is here what will it take me to save you…
