<p class="roast_line">You vowed to make your words unclear, but I am a tiger. I am the moon in your plans.  </p>
<p class="roast_line">and I took time away. I took the time away from you. bonfires at the city’s edge,</p>
<p class="roast_line">to make what leaves go away, closer. to make me away from you, apart from you, so</p>
<p class="roast_line">distant that I collided </p>
<p class="roast_line">into a brightness. It’s an unfinished thing. Where faces change into new faces,</p>
<p class="roast_line">—your widow’s peak </p>
<p class="roast_line">transforms into a hatch</p>
<p class="roast_line">-ing egg, </p>
<p class="roast_line">a life without yet DNA—</p>

<p class="roast_line">-dy in bon</p>
<p class="roast_line">-fire. </p>
<p class="roast_line">And if you were not a person but a feeling I would still want to walk past you. Walk</p>
<p class="roast_line">around you, not look ahead. Not watch the barometer turn into crystal’s errancy — errancy’s light, light’s feeling.</p>
<p class="roast_line">I was rushing towards you.</p>
<p class="roast_line">Molecule times molecule. Yes times yes. The King of Shanghai is watching over</p>
<p class="roast_line">from the excavator before the net bar, where crumbs fall to birds’ throats,</p>
<p class="roast_line">sketches of geese </p>
<p class="roast_line">and black tea.</p>
<p class="roast_line">how did you too know</p>
<p class="roast_line">your precise location,—</p>
<p class="roast_line">diaries of simone </p>

<p class="roast_line">blessings</p>
<p class="roast_line">yet buried</p>
<p class="roast_line">by the beach,</p>
<p class="roast_line">emptied we will be, of</p>
<p class="roast_line">the next evening. The best part of us. Heartfins, you move through</p>
<p class="roast_line">unlined water. Any boat on the dock, if you touch it it will disappear, leave</p>
<p class="roast_line">a crescent on your skin that is not a memory but the tail end of an unfinishing, an (    ) . The twenty years of sorrow sliding past. And your hands become thicker, blind stones ascending the season of storm.</p>
<p class="roast_line">Would something strange and beautiful happen, if my arm touches yours, </p>
<p class="roast_line">would the ceiling fall right beside us, would we survive, would we breathe again, </p>
<p class="roast_line">sweeping confettis over the open tile, would the overnight colors claim new names—</p>
<p class="roast_line">yes, overnight,</p>
<p class="roast_line">colors would claim you.</p>
<p class="roast_line">yes, the beer</p>
<p class="roast_line">    bottle and tomato</p>
<p class="roast_line">    resting on your</p>
<p class="roast_line">wide,</p>
<p class="roast_line">    clay leg</p>
<p class="roast_line">you will destroy with my daisy tree, </p>
<p class="roast_line">a tank,—</p>
<p class="roast_line">this is all what i mean </p>
<p class="roast_line">when our arms touch. pale yellow, </p>
<p class="roast_line">olive green like ko</p>

<p class="roast_line">[The camera turns on, the aquarium turns into a screen, the recording begins. Don’t look at me! You’re not supposed to look at me!]</p>
<p class="roast_line">Your body is cool like a jellyfish. Like glitter. Like glitter. Your body is the floor</p>
<p class="roast_line">below everything. Four bright lights, then three, then not enough. Then even that</p>
<p class="roast_line">becomes enough. Snow is heartbeat, deepfallow, you, she.</p>
<p class="roast_line">At dawn, you cover seaweed over your skin. Barges floating</p>
<p class="roast_line">like rootless trees. I see more birds coming back. Each with a lily in its beak.</p>
<p class="roast_line">A new language </p>
<p class="roast_line">is created each moment when words gush from your lips,</p>
<p class="roast_line">each moment,</p>
<p class="roast_line">a new flower breaks free.</p>
