no i’m not here for the wedding, my friend is. i’m not going to the wedding at all (system)
not because neither
of us know where praszka is, not 
also because both of us 
know where praszka isn’t,
but also not because
we know the stance each 
other takes in the situation
requiring one, the necessary
situation.
if i could be happier and more complicated
or happier
and completely simple i would
choose the complication. because the wedding
was in a forest i wanted to lay down
signs all over the canopy 
reflected on the floor,
every sign
leads away from the wedding. every
meaning leads me
to the wedding. (mercury
in neptune.) this being
the scene, the dialogue is as follows:
this wedding is no longer itself, C, and no
where a wedding at all. i only
knew how—the signs were a
nice touch, but of course not necessary—to get deeper 
into this forest. but certainly enough
there was a wedding (W, here substituting 
general for particular in 
a slip of the tongue, lets loose the wedding’s universal
horror which, previously, had rested between
praszka—where the wedding isn’t—and what 
we know incorrectly as praszka) to go 
away from.
i was almost asleep. K, who had gone to the wedding
told me about it in a theory
of brightness, what happened in the wedding but seen
from the perspective
of the possibility of another wedding where
brightness radiates outwards, not gathered
at the center of love but
in the increasing speed of its escape. bundles of bright forests, the
leaves i eat are lamps. the cherries
in my eyes are swaying fury—the sword.
the forest
and the sword. the brightness
and the quiver. bright forests, and the war, and
i was asleep, then i woke, and the waking preceded
the sleeping but happened
after it. i really wasn’t at the wedding, although
when i wasn’t there i hadn’t planned on going.
