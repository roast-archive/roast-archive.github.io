images are untouchable (you can touch the reel of film but not the image)
whatever you will reach 
with your essay
your deathbed will surely reach.
for what is across the table,
a sacrament (what you need
to make your life’s desire real, so as not
to live in a dream), you—
without the order given
—will not reach.
and then the sacrament becomes an ordinance. the order
was on fire once. the order was mountains

from the sanitorium, with handwritings which—
in your state (you hardly
would eat, and
when we met you asked me 
for cherries and nothing else)—

forces of will.
kinds of forces which 
will never reach an equilibrium,
and through which necessity was to meet good,—
the thin blind air of the mountains,
the window obscuring two young trees—
the summer house was filled with vampire bats who,
mom noticed, were attracted to the glasses
on our table—i thought, does the glass smell
of blood? but how could it since only our lips
were on it, and lips have nothing to do with blood, you
are climbing the trees,
and obviously work has to do with blood,

it’s like the joke you would tell
about the café without cream
which can only make you coffee without milk, not coffee without cream,
—like how the vampire bats can smell us
because obviously our lips aren’t bleeding
and we’ve already
