We might never raise non-being to being’s place, lower being to nothing. You wrote that with grandma in mind. You wrote that having already put it all into ghost literature. You wrote it with all the contradictions it implies in mind, everything about non-being we seemed to have fought so hard for…
and between non-being and nothing the sleeve of your blouse catches like fire in a film
lighting up, in the projector, where the film divides. and every night you sneak away
from your mother’s house into the river, for the sequence in perception it does to you—
mud, then water, then the grass, a metamorphic sexuality
from which you are hardly inspired. from which the sequence transforms into a series, the mud and then the water and then the grass and then the sexuality (which
here has lost its metamorphic character) underneath the additive ‘then,’ the absorptive ‘then,’
the quiet river which can at any time emerge and swallow you. you the prodigy, precisely 
you the absent friend. you hysterically brave under the mosaic’s spell—being
yourself of pieces, but believing in the unitary soul made of parts. and the part of you you keep immiscibly for yourself being
precisely the shadow that builds for itself a light behind the wall, and a cassandra behind the light (every wall
is a key shaped like a castle’s keep. built in a glacier.) the thing about contradiction is…
i won’t say it. you won’t get it out of me 😸. a crystal with three faces for the three phases of being: {beloved / marginality / completeness.} being’s
asundering—the castle can keep nothing inside it. non-being’s assimilation—peasants will not be free, violence can keep the castle in it. if, as you always like to say,
contradiction is an equilibrium between two forces, then why
are they guarding the empty castle walls? why do the walls not falling leave such a bad taste in our mouths? the forces
may be in equilibrium, but their exact counterforces are in complete disarray. the punishment
may be complete—these days, may even be graceful,—but in my dreams 
you’re so close i can touch you.
but i prefer static. dark green wool. but i believe, not in the concrete link but in the abstract windstorm, believe in SOUL, WORLD, JEWELS, REVENGE—
only three of those. griselda (name from the german, meaning “grey battle”) and bellerophon (from the greek, poseidon’s son), my terrifying lieutenants, the dark horde
of romans is running through the bubbles we are blowing at them. they are brilliant, in a way—beryllus. which makes my head freeze… flatten… just then, just in that moment
that passed, i sensed an uncertainty in you, what is the meaning of it?—the uncertainty is,
of course, that i don’t know whether the uncertainty is in me or you.
i don’t know whether our war will be total or incomplete. what i want to destroy in you 
has to be what you’ve already destroyed in yourself, otherwise… we’d be warriors and not, as 
we seem to be at precisely this moment, warriors in command. 
you prefer static but i prefer fireflies. you, dark green wool, me, your dark green wool. 
on contradiction, your mouth is shut. i am just beginning to speak silently—
Image. Image. Interruption.
