III. godmother
one. moments
will pass over
-head the houses, in
-side them. one.
roof trusses from 
your houses have
been used as 
charcoal, your vase
is emptied of beads, one
plus one. you
have stayed up
all night (he is gone)
and the morning
light is an
interiority
that excludes you. the
only exclusion that
is believable, lovable,
—the great beast 
will tell you this too,
against its
own interests in you,
you immediately have
to live 
like this—is
the scenario which, in this
act, you don’t enter
into, but 
in the next act
you do, (ignoring
all pretenses
of the last act’s time, that
this is actually a
disguised return, a
return hidden from
everyone in the room at
the precise moment when
it resembles
itself, for you 
to sneak in, in the very last act)
playing your ghost, which means,
in this current
act the beast
needs you to move, quickly.
through the forest like
the forest’s own dream
in the hair. and all
for what?, this
becoming-ghost, this image
of the dream only
the hair on your head
sees. a dour
love (one), never
on time. your childhood
dream of a little igloo
on that hill, stoppered
with jacquard honey,
a swarm of wasps so
intense it is like
you are here in this room (one)
writing. for years i have
run wild and now?
a warm welcome.
a bad dream.
you are here in this room
and you are alone but every
saturday will meet
everyone else
on this mountain
for synaxis—and 
when you forgive yourself
you’ll have great
spots on the beast, great leaps 
in the other different
room. every
thing—just then—you’ve
done will return to you again
as its night, you (the you
that you’ve managed to pull off) as
your-night, the
house as house-night (here, the sky 
gets darker 
and darker until you form a 
tense and beautiful cage with
it, and here, retain 
both yourself and the night sky,
like bait, 
you know its eyes are on you and can see you…)
the inner product as inner
product-night, the outer product, things
that i’m holding for you in people, 
as outer product-night. night is
when i can see you. when something
disappears, not in the place
it occupied but to its side, in
this place’s shifting i can see you,
not the place
you take but the place you use.
between 4am and 6am is
the orchard’s stretch, and
the pails of cold water
in the orchard, and the orchard
is not opposed to the night but
the diagonal
cutting
across it,
parallel but above
the dream, drowned not
drowning. awake, not waking.
