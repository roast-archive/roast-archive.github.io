II. 
the totality of night
in this poem
has to be
continuous with
the totality
of night.
the continuous
has
to be the irreplaceable,
every piece 
a distant
murder 
that we are 
just barely 
able to 
understand, a
deal gone 
sour, 
catastrophic
just 
at the point
where we
almost (and this
is where 
night has to
be between
two people, 
but then, when 
they aren’t expecting, 
involving
everyone else)
made all the money.
(and this
is where
you go
wrong. where,
thinking
out of frustration
that you don’t
understand me
at all, at any
crucial
instant, you
actually
understand
me completely. take
a detour
through the gallery
of modern
art and meet me
there, at
the dazzle gallery.)
of course this
means 
we could live without
any money, although
we would 
rather die first.
of course this 
means 
if you were living
without 
any money, i would
live with you, just so that
—without, both
of us, together, living 
with money—
we wouldn’t both
be living, together, without money.
somewhere in between
those two i’ve
already loved you,—
this being a love
poem in
its innermost continuity,
the one in between negatives,
predicates, nights,
—this being
night from inside
the perspective
of the dream, the
night you build
a pool around me.
these are my socks,
love. this
the word for frost
in spanish, love.
these are the books
i’ve read, love. these are
pieces of the night
in its totality which,
being continuous,
is a surface whose every
section (not piece)
should
be deducible
and yet isn’t. which means
any piece
that’s lost
is lost. thanks
to the totality, its rules.
what does it mean—to
rule,—for me 
to you. 
in the spirit we’re on the battlefield.
