<p class="roast_line">Scenes of life (after some Calder thing…) (after talking about life) (after changing places) (after carefully considering all relevant chemicals…)</p>
<p class="roast_line">calder wake up. not from dying. the look</p>
<p class="roast_line">on a stranger’s face. when it feels like,</p>
<p class="roast_line">for a split second, you could know them.</p>
<p class="roast_line">understand. dog. what follows emptiness </p>
<p class="roast_line">but always precedes the next thing. </p>
<p class="roast_line">what that is i was hoping you knew. </p>
<p class="roast_line">what we are i was hoping you knew. earth</p>
<p class="roast_line">wake up aliens are here. and they miss troy,</p>
<p class="roast_line">cleopatra’s pearls, leaves in envelopes</p>
<p class="roast_line">of silk. when the sirens rang over </p>
<p class="roast_line">new york i got out the map we made,</p>
<p class="roast_line">in middle school, as a joke—the one on</p>
<p class="roast_line">gold hide, cement. the blank one with our names on it.</p>
<p class="roast_line">the joke that contained our entire lives. </p>
<p class="roast_line">calder wake up because i can’t stand your dream </p>
<p class="roast_line">any longer. dream wake up, i miss talking with you. about</p>
<p class="roast_line">what art doesn’t understand. what misunderstanding</p>
<p class="roast_line">is constitutive of art. why hope. why hope</p>
<p class="roast_line">disappears like a scratch-mark on a huge</p>
<p class="roast_line">block of ice. do you know me? do you</p>
<p class="roast_line">cold me? i am rigid cold,—yes. yes. yes</p>
<p class="roast_line">of course, although you don’t know why.—leaves in</p>
<p class="roast_line">envelopes will you ever turn to mortar. cleopatra’s</p>
<p class="roast_line">pearls will you ever turn to outer space, knowing</p>
<p class="roast_line">precisely nothing about art. humans, ice, nothing </p>
<p class="roast_line">of what you expect you will expect. nothing </p>
<p class="roast_line">of what you try to save will be saved for calder.</p>
<p class="roast_line">we look like we’re asleep on a boat anchored</p>
<p class="roast_line">before the journey. why does it matter. we</p>
<p class="roast_line">can’t see us. each of us can see each other</p>
<p class="roast_line">but we can’t see us. we, us. each other, us.</p>
<p class="roast_line">what will it take me to save you.</p>
<p class="roast_line">what will it take me to save you.</p>
<p class="roast_line">earth the split second before the joke makes sense</p>
<p class="roast_line">is here what will it take me to save you…</p>
