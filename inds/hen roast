If a hen is hurt, the others rush up and peck it. This system… is as automatic as gravity… 
I.
the old world. the towers with battlements guarded by archers in front
of frescoes of the procession. you are nothing, you are bringing
someone to life like a you-were. 
you are bringing to bear
the center of the world (of which you know the precise character
but not the location) 
for the sake of the old world, ferrous kishke—stunned light,
your sleeves (black double gauze) rolled up, drunk out of
your/their minds on bougainvillea wine. it’s the old world, which means
we’re. masts, linen, rock-quarry. recipes for kykeon
and broken honey.
the enemy is swift. dew and manna cover our arrowheads—
when will you return to me after this?
when will you return to me after this? 
perhaps when the new world is found—filled with things we have lostless.
songs of our bowmen., (for less 
ordered phases, spin glass.)
songs that make it possible. again. songs that make real people
to make themselves happen—VI, I, V. VI, I, V. VI, I, V. VI, I, V.
rain it down on me. the precipitation. the weightening. four lances
thru his beautiful side. 
four for your chickens indoors., for each our father
(each containing every possible petition—me, by the northern 
gate, layin' on thirty blows) an'
there’s nothing to bury. sometimes lightning comes to the surface
of the earth from beneath—there’s nothing to bury.
good morning, old world. good morning, my old one. we
make coffee with chives with the window open and the air
is oceanic. it’s giant with edges. it make me love
being here, being here as destroying here, as shuttles draped
in palm-wool in dark rooms
—a woolen paroches folded over ten thousand times.
—i will walk thru bounty
while you spear me. 
there i will always burn hyssop—
destroy blindness and rightness equally.
old world—with your hands will you work,
your body is a half-crushed worm. half-bounty.
